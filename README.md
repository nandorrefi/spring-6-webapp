# Spring Framework 6: Beginner to Guru

This repository is for an example application built in my [Spring Framework 6 - Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-6-beginner-to-guru/?referralCode=2BD0B7B7B6B511D699A9) online course

The application is a simple Spring Boot 3 / Spring Framework 6 web application. It is used to help students learn how
to use the Spring Framework. Step by step instructions and detailed explanations can be found within the course.

# My Notes

## Spring Framework and Spring Boot

In 2003 EJB was referred to as "XML Java Hell" this is what Spring Framework replaced

Spring Framework: collection of framework libraries

Spring Boot: automated tooling for Spring applications, think about it like a wrapper around Spring

Spring boot:
* has starter dependencies
* auto-configs for classes found on classpath (ex.: autoconfigs in memory database if H2 is on class path)

By default Spring Boot:
* has integrated tomcat server
* responds with HTML via HTTP to requests made to tomcat server

There are multiple Spring projects:
* Spring Data	- Collection of projects for persisting data to SQL and noSQL DBs
* Spring Cloud	- Tools for distributed systems, good for microservices and cloud services
* Spring Security
* Spring Session	- Distributed web app sessions
* Spring Integration	- Enterprise Integration Patterns
* Spring Batch	- batch processing
* Spring State Machine	- open source state machine


## App Overview

![overview](docs/overview.png "Overview")

A simple Spring Boot architecture that we will use as our first app.

![packages](docs/packages.png "Packages")

We will have 4 packages.

Maven specifies the Standard Directory Layout that maven projects should follow, 
this is what spring initializer follows too: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html

## H2 Database

Spring Boot comes with a H2 in-memory database.

To enable console you should configure the project. Example for .properties:
```properties
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
```

Then after starting up the spring boot service the logs will show something like this:
```
2024-10-13T...  INFO 3688 --- [main] o.s.b.a.h2.H2ConsoleAutoConfiguration    : H2 console available at '/h2-console'. Database available at 'jdbc:h2:mem:{DB ID}'
```

By default, on http://localhost:8080/h2-console you will find the console. The 'jdbc:h2:mem:{DB ID}' string will define the JDBC URL that you can connect to in the console.

## Hibernate

Hibernate creates the database tables by reflection based on our defined entities in the domain package.

## Spring MVC

### MVC Architecture

M: Model 

V: View 

C: Controller

![mvc-diagram](docs/MVC_diagram.png "MVC Diagram")

### Spring MVC

MODEL: In Spring MVC it's a simple POJO, stores the data, view may or may not need it.

VIEW: Data as requested by the client. Implemented with JSP, Thymeleaf, Jackson. Can be HTML, JSON, XML, text etc.

CONTROLLER: Java class implemented to handle request mapping. Should contain minimal business logic. 
Typically works in conjunction with a service, which contains the business logic.

![spring-mvc-diagram](docs/spring_mvc_diagram.png "Spring MVC Diagram")

During development, we won't interact much with the servlet and view. This is handled by Spring.
